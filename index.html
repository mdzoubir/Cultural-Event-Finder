                    <p>
                        It was the best choice we could have made. It was an incredible and unforgettable experience.
                        Said is very professional and exceedingly knowledgeable about Morocco – its history, geography,
                        politics, people – and eager to share this knowledge if you show an interest. It was a pleasure
                        spending time with him and learning about his wonderful country. I would highly recommend Open
                        Doors Morocco to everyone wishing a true Moroccan experience. From the 4×4 (which had wifi!) to
                        the desert camp accommodations, everything was perfect.

                        I feel like we saw the “real Morocco” not just the touristy sites but some hidden gems also.
                        From the time Habib met us at the airport, I felt like we were in good hands.
